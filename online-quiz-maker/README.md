# Online_QuizeMaker

I'll create an interactive quiz platform with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that includes all the requested features. Since we're using only frontend technologies, we'll use localStorage to persist data.

## Features Overview

This interactive quiz platform includes all the requested features:

## How to Use

1. **As a Quiz Taker**:

2. Take quizzes and see your results
3. View your ranking on the leaderboard



2. **As a Quiz Creator**:

## Technical Implementation

The application uses:

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling (responsive design)
- JavaScript for functionality
- localStorage for data persistence


Since this is a frontend-only implementation, all data is stored in the browser's localStorage.
